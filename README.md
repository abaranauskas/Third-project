# Third-project
PSD to HTML and CSS

After second project I wanted to make some step up and asked my friend front-end developer advise what to do next. So that is how I found out about PhotoShop design files and deepen my knowleges into PhotoShope application. This tutorial was very helpful and gave me good skills how to crop the PSD file and convert it into HTML and CSS
